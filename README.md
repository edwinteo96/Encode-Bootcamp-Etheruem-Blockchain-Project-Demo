## Description

During this encode bootcamp , I have learn alot about Web3 technologies and how to interact with blockchain using ether.js , metamask sdk and frontend such as angular and nuxtjs as backend to faciliate the API routing.

We have also coded smart contracts using hardhat tool suite to ease the development and testing of smart contracts.

Below also attached some screenshots from the final project that we hacked through out the week. 
It was fun indeed to scratch our heads around the whole blockchain APIs.

For the final project,  we have an idea of a simple web3 wallet and also lock token smart contract.
